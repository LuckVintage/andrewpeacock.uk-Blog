Recently, I ordered takeaway food from Just Eat. For context, the particular restaurant outlet handles deliveries themselves and does not appoint a Just Eat delivery partner to make deliveries on their behalf. None of the below is a reflection of Just Eat.

I placed my order on a Friday at 5:30 pm sharp. The total value (including delivery fees, service charges, and a bag fee) was £43.75. To clarify, I wasn't ordering just for myself! It took them an hour and 20 minutes to arrive with the food, and I found out that I was missing one portion of large chips (worth £3.99).

I called them up straight away, but I didn't get through the first time. Their landline rang and rang, and eventually went to voicemail. I waited about a minute and called back, and they answered this time. The takeaway apologized for the missing chips and said they'd have them delivered in around 15 minutes.

The missing chips were part of my meal, and I was only left with two large sausages and a can of drink. One hour and 3 minutes passed, and they still hadn't arrived, so I decided to give them another call. They apologized for a second time and said they couldn't give a timeframe for when the missing chips would eventually arrive. They finally arrived at 8:20 pm, almost 3 hours after placing my initial order.

Whenever things like this have happened in the past with other takeaways, I always tell myself that it doesn't matter that they made a mistake, we all forget things. I never mark them down for making the mistake either. Instead, I believe I should score them on how they rectify the issue and make things right. You'd like to think the takeaway would rush the forgotten food to you, and as much as I don't want to give this particular takeaway a bad review, can you really accept waiting 1 hour and 30 minutes for them to deliver one portion of missing chips?

I think there has to be a cut-off point where you can no longer forgive the takeaway outlet. It was no longer a minor inconvenience but a ruined meal. I can forgive them for forgetting the chips in the first instance, but for their poor actions to rectify the issue within a reasonable timeframe is something I can't forgive.

Remember, they said 15 minutes to me on the phone when I first called up, but they took 5 times longer than this. While I understand they can't give an exact timeframe, and I don't expect them to be bang on time either, but to be one hour and 15 minutes longer than you originally said is quite bad service in my opinion.

I must also say I really wasn't particularly impressed with the portion size I received - it was more like a small chips in my opinion. I can't fault the two different people I spoke to on the phone or the delivery driver - they were all really friendly and apologetic, but this doesn't make up for how long I was left waiting for the rest of my dinner to arrive.

This takeaway has always been outstanding in the past. I've placed quite a few orders with them and have always been very pleased with the service received. I plan to order from them again and give them another chance - but I can only hope this is just an isolated incident and will not happen again in the future.

I think there are three things the restaurant could have done better to handle this situation and turn my frustrating experience into a positive one. I feel like they should have rushed the missing item to me as quickly as possible. Waiting for over an hour and a half for one missing portion of chips is not reasonable in my opinion and was very frustrating for me as a customer. The takeaway should have also provided an accurate timeframe for delivery. While it's understandable that they cannot give an exact timeframe for when they'll arrive with the missing item, they should have given a more realistic estimate for when they expect to deliver it. With the above in mind, I feel like they should have offered me some kind of compensation. It doesn't have to be anything major - offering a small discount or free item would have been a good gesture to ensure me that they acknowledge their mistake and value my business as a customer.

Overall, if I had known ahead of time that it would take the takeaway one hour and 30 minutes to deliver the forgotten chips, I probably would have just taken some chips out of the freezer and put them in the air fryer, as well as requested a refund for the missing item on Just Eat. I feel like that would have been a much quicker outcome for both myself and the takeaway!
