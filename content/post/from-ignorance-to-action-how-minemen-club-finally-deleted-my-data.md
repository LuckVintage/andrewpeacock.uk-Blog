About two years ago, I went through my password manager and cleared out accounts I no longer required. I usually do this every couple of years, mainly to tidy things up. One of these accounts was for the website minemen.club, a Minecraft server. I don't remember signing up to this website, but I suspect it was around 2017/2018. I don't recall ever playing on the server either. Since I no longer use the account on the website and have no intentions of playing on their Minecraft server, following best practices, I wanted to delete my account. There is no point in having an account for something I'm never going to use, and it just opens up my personal details to being exposed to potential data breaches needlessly. And if my account were to get logged in to by someone who isn't me, everything they do would be under my name and reputation. This is a risk we take with accounts we use regularly, but this isn't something I should have to be concerned about for an account I never use. As a result, I would either like them to delete my account or at a bare minimum deactivate it so nobody, including me, can log in and cause damage under my name.

Upon logging into the website, I struggled to find an option in the user interface to delete or deactivate my account, it would appear such an option did not exist. So I opened up a support ticket on the website and politely asked them to delete my account. Usually, when I'm clearing up old accounts, I only have to ask the company to delete my account and 90% of the time they comply with my request and don't cause a big fuss.

After submitting my ticket, I went back to going through my password manager and doing the same for other websites I no longer have any interest in using.

Fast forward 2 years later, September 2024, and I'm going through my password manager once again and came across my account for minemen.club that was still here. This isn't unusual as not all websites seem to send any confirmation of deleting my account, and I don't remove anything from my password manager until I'm certain I don't need the information anymore. I attempted to log in to see if my account was still active, and I was logged in straight away. It appears they didn't delete my account as previously requested. I vaguely remembered the site from before and went to the support tickets section, to which I found my ticket closed with a rather abrupt response saying they can't delete my account.

![Screenshot of reply to my closed support ticket](/images/minemenclubdeleteaccountscreenshotreply.png#center)

I was a little annoyed about this because had I known there was a reply, I would have responded straight away. I had no email from them to inform me of their response, so the only way anyone was ever going to know if there was a response to their support ticket was if they manually went and checked the website. At this point, the ticket was closed and as such, I was unable to respond. Considering 2 years have passed, this was understandable. My only option was to create a brand new ticket, asking them to delete my account again. Knowing they had previously refused, I decided it would be best to send them a more formal legal notice, using the website https://yourdigitalrights.org. I have used this site many times in the past, as they make it very easy to generate data deletion request messages without needing to know anything. I simply copied/pasted the message in, and submitted the ticket. Since this was a more formal method of asking them to delete my account, I was hoping they would realise I wasn't going away and would simply comply. Persistence is key in cases like this.

![Screenshot of my second support ticket](/images/minemenclubdatadeletionrequestscreenshot.png#center)

Around 8 hours later, I decided to check back on the website, having remembered I didn't receive any email notifying me of a response last time. And to my surprise, there was a reply! It wasn't quite what I was expecting though, as they point-blank refused with a rather abrupt reply similar to last time and they even closed the ticket, preventing me from being able to reply.

![Screenshot of reply to my second support ticket](/images/minemenclubdatadeletionrequestscreenshotreply.png#center)

I was rather perplexed as to why this website did not want to delete my account, they haven't provided me with any reasoning, instead just saying no. Why are they so desperate to keep my data? If they responded with a valid reason, maybe I would have let it go and moved on with my life. But as far as I'm concerned, refusing to delete my account without providing any kind of reasoning isn't acceptable. If you're not going to delete my account, I think I'm more than entitled to know why. And besides that, from my understanding, their response was not in compliance with data protection laws. The data controller has legal obligations to respond in a timely fashion (30 days), and provide an acknowledgement of my request as well as a justification for denial if they wish to decline. As they declined my request without providing me with any reason as to why, it would seem like they are in breach of the Data Protection Act of 2018. I am very concerned about the lack of adequate communication I have so far received. It would be nice to know who exactly at the company I am talking with, is this just a normal member of staff designated to handle tickets and my request is above their pay grade? Or was my request forwarded and responded to by their data protection officer? Since no name or position was included with any of their responses, I have absolutely zero idea who I'm talking to. In cases like this, it's very important that an appropriate person takes the lead and deals with my case. It is not acceptable for someone who is not experienced enough in this type of request to respond.

Since my soft approach didn't work two years ago, and taking into account their repeated denial, I wanted to make sure I kept constructing formal responses in case I felt the need to escalate this issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) further down the road. I decided to ask ChatGPT to construct a response for me, that I would use as a template for my reply. With some slight modifications and some fact-checking, I was ready to send my reply. As I mentioned earlier, they closed my ticket straight away after replying, so if I wanted to send them another message, my only option was to create a brand new support ticket.

![Screenshot of my second reply to my second support ticket](/images/minemenclubdatadeletionrequestscreenshotreply2.png#center)

The main idea behind my reply was to ask them to provide a legal justification for why they declined my request. They are obliged to provide me with this information, so if they also refuse, there's no doubt that it'll be an open-and-shut case for the ICO if I were to escalate this and report them. I also wanted them to confirm who I was talking to, or at the very least provide me with contact information so I can make sure I'm talking to their data protection officer. Because at the moment, I'm still not satisfied that I'm talking to the correct person. Any qualified data protection officer wouldn't deny my request with no explanation. This is in breach of the Data Protection Act and the ICO can investigate and potentially fine the company for this violation. Ideally, I did not want to go down this road, but if the company isn't going to provide me with a satisfactory response and resolution within 30 days, what else am I meant to do?

Since submitting my reply, I checked my ticket multiple times per day to make sure I didn't miss anything from them, and just over 6 days later, I finally had a response. It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for though.

![Screenshot of reply to my second closed support ticket](/images/minemenclubdatadeletionrequestscreenshotreply3.png#center)

While this response is certainly a big improvement from the blatant 'no' I received last time, it still doesn't fully comply with the Data Protection Act and I can't say I'd be satisfied if this was the outcome either. Simply telling me to log out of my account if I no longer wish to use the service is not an acceptable response to someone who wants their data deleted. I don't know what took them almost a week to come up with this reply, considering they responded and closed my first data deletion request within 2 hours. 

I've got two main problems with the reply I received. They still didn't clearly state the specific legal basis or exception under the DPA they are relying on to deny my request, and the "Essential for Account Functionality" justification is absolute rubbish. At this point I'm certain that they are either trying to fob me off so they don't have to delete my account, or as I previously suspected, my request is being dealt with by a normal member of staff instead of a qualified Data Protection Officer. I suspect this because anyone with knowledge of the Data Protection Act would know that this justification doesn't hold up unless I am still using the service, or for them to deliver the service. I've already made my intention to no longer use the service very clear. Either way, this is not a valid reason for not deleting my account in this specific scenario. Even if this was a valid justification, it still wouldn't fully comply with the Data Protection Act because they didn't clearly state the specific types of data that they claim are necessary for maintaining my account, provide any exceptions or legal reasons under the Data Protection Act or offer an opt-out or data minimization process, such as being able to deactivate my account instead of outright deleting it.

I decided to craft another response, having to open yet another brand new support ticket as in 10 hours they already closed my previous one, preventing me from directly responding. The main concept behind this response was to get them to clarify their legal basis in greater detail. For them to refuse my request, they need to have a valid legal basis as outlined in the Data Protection Act. I hoped that my response and persistence would pressure them to provide a more legally sound explanation or simply comply with my deletion request.

![Screenshot of my third reply to my third support ticket](/images/minemenclubdatadeletionrequestscreenshotreply4.png#center)

I received a response relatively swiftly, within 2 hours. Good thing I kept checking the website. I was still unable to reply though, so it seems like they are just closing the support request as soon as they reply, making it frustrating for me to respond and keep track of everything.

![Screenshot of my fourth reply to my fourth support ticket](/images/minemenclubdatadeletionrequestscreenshotreply5.png#center)

Wow, just wow. I just could not believe what I was reading. They have now outright said that don't delete data which is an insufficient response to my request and potentially unlawful. If they have a legitimate reason for retaining my data, they are required to specify which legal exceptions they are relying on, which so far they have yet to do so despite multiple opportunities. Their claim that the DPA is "to make sure the information is: used fairly, lawfully and transparently" is not relevant to my request. Yes, this is one part of the Data Protection Act but the DPA also guarantees individual rights, including the right to erasure. They are required to either comply with my erasure request or provide specific legal exceptions that allow them to refuse it. It would seem the person responding to my request has done some research, but they have completely misinterpreted the DPA. This is why it is so important that tickets like this are dealt with by the Data Protection Officer, as they will have all the knowledge to appropriately and lawfully handle my request. If these responses are coming directly from their Data Protection Officer, then it makes everything much worse. The fact that they are trying to pass the responsibility to another platform is laughable. My Minecraft account has absolutely no relevance to my request and simply does not address the issue. They still have not explained under which legal basis they are continuing to process my personal data and at this point, I'm starting to lose my patience. I was very tempted to stop bothering directly with them and make a report to the ICO for their repeated failure to take my request seriously. Either this or they are misinterpreting their legal obligations, which is equally as bad. Despite this, I thought it was only right to send them a final warning before I decided whether to take further action against them. I hoped that this would prompt them to take my request more seriously, and further research their legal obligations. It would appear they looked more into the DPA after my last message but only took into account one of the many aspects of the Data Protection Act. I am hoping the threat of being reported to the ICO will encourage them to research other aspects of the DPA and provide an appropriate response to my erasure request.

7 days quickly went by and I heard absolutely nothing from Minemen Club. Usually, I would give the company the full 30 days the DPA gives companies to comply and potentially extra time if they need it, but since they have refused to act upon my request several times and considered the matter closed on their end, I didn't think waiting any longer was going to change their decision. As a result, I started constructing my email to the ICO, once again using ChatGPT for assistance. With a few modifications, I sent my email.

![Screenshot of my initial email to the ICO](/images/emailtoicosmall.png#center)

I received a confirmation email from the ICO a few seconds later. The matter is now in the hands of the Information Commissioner's Office, and they said they aim to get back to me within 28 days. I will be very interested to hear what they have to say about this matter.

I thought it would only be right to let Minemen Club know I had escalated the matter to the ICO, so I added a reply to my previous support ticket. Letting them know that the ICO is now involved may push them to comply with my request without further delay. Some companies act quickly once they realize the complaint is under official investigation. I am hoping they may comply now I have informed them. But I have to be mindful of any messages I send their way, as there is an official investigation being conducted. Any further messages sent and received since I initially sent my complaint to the ICO will make the investigation confusing and hard to follow, so I think I should avoid trying to deal with Minemen Club directly unless they are willing to offer a suitable resolution to my complaint and put things right. If they still refuse to comply, I won't bother making another ticket with them but instead, take screenshots of the correspondence and forward them straight to the ICO to be included in their investigation.

![Screenshot of my reply to my fourth support ticket](/images/minemenclubdatadeletionrequestscreenshotreply7.png#center)

To my utter shock, I had a reply from Minemen Club a few hours later! It seems like reporting them to the ICO has made them have a sudden change of heart, and my account deletion request is "being processed as we speak." While I am very pleased it seems they are finally taking my request seriously, their response does seem somewhat contradictory. In their earlier messages, they indicated that they could not delete my data, which can reasonably be interpreted as a refusal. Statements like "we do not delete data" and suggesting I log out instead of complying with my request indicate that they were not willing to act on my request. In my opinion, stating that my account deletion request is "not being refused or denied" and is "being processed" seems to be another way of them essentially saying they have changed their mind and are now willing to proceed with the deletion of my data. I'll never know for sure what prompted them to backtrack all of a sudden but have a feeling they decided to look more into the Data Protection Act after I informed them I had reported them to the ICO. Upon realising just how serious non-compliance is, chances are they thought they better process my request to prevent themselves from getting in trouble. Either way, I'm very happy with the positive development.

![Screenshot of reply to my fourth support ticket](/images/minemenclubdatadeletionrequestscreenshotreply8.png#center)

Since they are now willing to take my request seriously, I didn't want to dwell too much on the previous responses. But I did want to mention the inconsistency in their replies while maintaining a polite and professional tone. At the end of the day, the main focus here is to make sure my request gets fulfilled. I wanted to make sure I sent them some kind of acknowledgement so they know I'm still actively paying attention to the matter despite having escalated to it the ICO. Asking for an estimated timeline keeps them accountable and will hopefully ensure they follow through. Asking for confirmation when they have fulfilled my request is very important, as it ensures that I have documented evidence of the action taken should I need it in the future.

![Screenshot of my reply to my fourth support ticket](/images/minemenclubdatadeletionrequestscreenshotreply9.png#center)

Since I've already reported Minemen Club to the ICO, I should keep them updated on any significant developments, and this is most definitely a pretty significant development in the grand scheme of things. In this case, though, I'm going to wait until Minemen Club confirms the deletion of my personal data or fails to act in a reasonable timeframe. Given I first requested they delete my data on 20th September, I will give them 30 days from this date. It's just a shame it took exactly two weeks of back and forth to get them to confirm they'll do something. When they say my request is being processed as we speak, it gives the impression they are actively working on it so I'm hoping I'll hear back before the 30 days I initially gave them expires.

Sadly, I'm afraid to say I didn't hear anything new from Minemen Club within the 30-day period. Considering I had already reported them to the ICO, I decided to give Minemen Club a little longer. I gave them 30 days from the last communication I had from them, which was the message where they said "It is being processed as we speak." Considering the circumstances, I think this is more than reasonable. Either way, I wanted to say something because I didn't want Minemen Club to think I'd forgotten, so I simply requested an update from them and informed them of the 30-day period the Data Protection Act usually expects requests to be fulfilled in.

![Screenshot of my reply to my fifth support ticket](/images/minemenclubdatadeletionrequestscreenshotreply10.png#center)

At this point, I didn't really know if I was going to hear anything back, or even if they would delete my data as requested. There wasn't really much I could do other than wait for the ICO to get back to me so I could update them. Unless by some miracle they eventually happen to delete my data in the meantime.

As I've been doing throughout the process, I attempted to log in a few days later to check if there were any updates, and I'm pleased to see it seems my account has finally been deleted. At least I can only assume so, as I have not received any confirmation from Minemen Club as requested. I can only assume my data has been deleted because I can no longer log into my account, with the website citing that my user was not found.

Now it seems my data has been deleted, what do I do about the ICO? As of today, 3rd December 2024, I haven't heard anything from the ICO in response to my initial request. They said they aim to get back to people within 28 days, but it has currently been exactly 60 days without a reply. As a result, I will stand the ICO down when they do eventually get back to me. Since it would seem Minemen Club did eventually comply with my request, I don't see the point in getting the ICO involved anymore. But I do think it's important that Minemen Club learn how to deal with any kind of Data Protection Requests appropriately. Things should not have had to be escalated as far as they did, and I really shouldn't have to be writing this blog post about them.

Minemen Club should've handled the situation much better. To start with, the lack of transparent and prompt communication is a significant issue. Many of my responses went unanswered for a significant period, which is just not acceptable. I don't expect Minemen Club to get back to me on the same day, but having to wait weeks and chase them up all the time is awful customer service. When they first learned of my request, they should've quickly acknowledged it and set out an expected timeline for action (up to 30 days, per the DPA and GDPR) would have set clear expectations. Instead, I received a response saying they can't "do that" which is the exact opposite of what they should have done. This leads to the second major issue. If they believed they were unable to delete my account, Minemen Club was required by the Data Protection Act to provide a specific legal basis for denying my request, which they failed to do multiple times. Instead, they should've cited the relevant articles from the DPA and offered a justification relevant to my specific case. If Minemen Club genuinely thought they had the right to retain all or part of my data, instead of offering a vague response, Minemen Club should have explained their data retention policy, detailing why certain data needed to be retained (if legally required) and for how long, along with whether they could consider anonymizing it if deletion wasn’t possible. If they couldn’t delete my account, Minemen Club should have offered alternatives like deactivation or data minimization, which would limit the personal data they retain while preserving account functionality. This approach aligns with the GDPR’s principles of data minimization and storage limitation. Many of Minemen Club's responses did not align with the Data Protection Act, and because nobody responding to my tickets identified themselves, I was never sure who I was talking to. However, due to the nature of their responses, it would seem I was not talking to their Data Protection Officer (assuming they have one.) Each communication should have identified the responder’s role (e.g., DPO, Customer Support, Legal Team), which would have given me clarity on who is handling my request. If the person responding was not the Data Protection Officer, they should have forwarded the ticket to whoever was responsible and had the knowledge to deal with it best. Minemen Club should've allowed me to respond to tickets, instead of instantly closing them after replying. Closing tickets immediately after responding without leaving them open for follow-up questions creates a frustrating loop for users who still need to talk to someone. Minemen Club should have kept my tickets open for a reasonable period or allowed responses, showing respect for customer follow-ups and feedback. Minemen Club should have a more robust ticket system in place to automatically notify users when there is a response waiting to read, and when a ticket is closed. This lack of notification was a significant barrier to resolution in my case, meaning I had to keep checking the website every few hours to make sure I didn't miss any potential updates from them.  For sensitive requests like data deletion, offering a separate escalation path (e.g., "Contact Data Protection Officer") could ensure that customers are directed to the right person, especially if they’re dissatisfied with the initial responses. A simple email address would suffice, but right now it would seem the current support ticket system does not work for these requests. 

It’s a small victory that my data was deleted, but it’s clear that Minemen Club has a long way to go in terms of improving its data protection practices and customer support. This ordeal could have been avoided if Minemen Club had a proper procedure in place to follow. Ultimately, the process took far longer than necessary, but I hope Minemen Club, and others, will learn from this experience to ensure future data deletion requests are handled with the urgency and professionalism they deserve.
