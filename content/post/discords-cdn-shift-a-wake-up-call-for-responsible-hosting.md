On the 29th of September, Discord posted an announcement on the Discord Developers server titled "New Authenticated Attachment URL Parameters." To save you all the technical jargon, this means that attachments uploaded to Discord will have some extra information at the end of the link, and if you share the link with somebody outside of Discord, it will expire after 24 hours. Discord has said that attachment URLs have already started to follow this new pattern, but they have no plans to enforce the expiration until later this year. Below is a screenshot of this announcement.

First, there is mass confusion surrounding this new change. Many people have the impression that Discord will delete many old attachments and think this new update will stop you from sharing memes and other uploaded media with your friends. This is not the case; attachments inside Discord will continue to function just as they always have. This update only applies to content shared outside of the platform. Most typical users will be unaffected by this change. People who want to share uploaded media with people outside of Discord will still be able to do so as long as it's viewed within the expiry time, which is currently 24 hours.

I believe this change is mainly aimed at people who are, in my opinion, abusing Discord's CDN by using it as a personal file host. Discord is a messaging platform that allows you to upload attachments to share with others. It can be anything from images to zip files. I've seen many websites in the past that are hosting content, such as downloads and embedding images directly from Discord's CDN. Discord is NOT your personal file host, and I don't think people should've been doing this in the first place. It's very cheeky. Many people don't seem to realise or care that it costs Discord a lot of money because they can't be bothered to host their content properly. And people seem to be very angry about this new update, moaning about how it'll break their website. If this is you, then you've only got yourself to blame for using Discord for something that it isn't designed for. I would even go as far as to say this is straight-up abuse of Discord's CDN. If I were the owner of a massive messaging platform like Discord, I would be furious to learn that people use my servers to host things outside of Discord. The number of people doing this daily costs Discord a lot of money. I'm astonished that it has taken Discord this long to take action regarding people abusing the CDN, and people should consider themselves lucky that they've been able to get away with blatant CDN abuse for so long. Yes, I fully understand that people need to host their images and website downloads somewhere, but people should've used a proper file host for this in the first place. Discord never intended for people to use their CDN this way, and I don't think people have the right to be angry at Discord for making this change. If people cared enough about the files on their website, they should not have abused a third party to save them the money, effort and time of hosting it themselves. And to get angry at Discord for finally cracking down on people doing this is beyond belief. Discord does not advertise itself anywhere as a free file host or content delivery network, so why do so many people think they can use the platform as such? Discord has been taking the hit and paying to host content on other people's websites for years, and I'm delighted they are finally cracking down on it. Anyone affected by this change should've thought twice before outright taking advantage of Discord for their gain. I'll never understand why people didn't do things properly in the first place. It isn't hard to use an actual file hosting service; there are many free ones available, as well as paid. But if people cared enough about their website in the first place, they would've put the money in and done things right.

Now, there are some genuine reasons why people may want to embed content uploaded to Discord on their website, such as sites directly associated with bots. Reusing existing content, such as profile pictures, makes sense instead of downloading and hosting it themselves. I'm pleased to say this change does not affect profile pictures, only attachments. I am more than happy with this as long as you provide some service to Discord. For example, if you have a website for a Discord bot, such as Dank Memer, you should be able to embed content from Discord's CDN. But if you're hosting a website that has nothing to do with Discord but is using their CDN to host your images, then this crosses the line.

Some people may not have realised how much they were costing Discord by using their CDN to host content for their website. I don't think everyone affected by this has intentionally abused Discord's CDN. Still, now that this information has come to light, people have time to make alterations and prevent websites from breaking when the updates come into full force later this year. Discord should've given a more accurate time frame. I feel that 'later this year' needs to be more specific and could be anytime. This update will also affect people who have shared links to content inside Discord on sites like Reddit. While I don't think these people were abusing the CDN, it's important to remember that Discord wasn't designed as a file-sharing website. It might be quick and convenient to use Discord, but an actual file hosting company should have been used for long-term, reliable access. It's very unfair to get mad at Discord for implementing this change. If Discord advertised itself as a file-sharing company in any way, shape, or form, this would be very different. But it's on you because you've taken it upon yourself to use Discord for this purpose despite not being advertised. It's pretty simple: don't use a website for a purpose it was never intended for.

In conclusion, this is a very positive change. I have been a Discord Nitro subscriber since September 2020, and I'd much rather Discord spends my money on hosting the actual Discord website instead of being spent on hosting content for somebody else's. Any individual using the CDN whose website will break when this update comes into full force only has themselves to blame. Don't try using Discord for something it was never designed to do. Discord is a messaging platform, not your file-hosting solution. Take the time and do things properly; don't exploit a third party for your gain.
