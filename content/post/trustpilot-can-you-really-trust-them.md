In November last year, I decided I would sign up for an account with Trustpilot. I'm always shopping online and I get invited to leave reviews quite frequently, so making an account made sense. After creating my account, I thought it would be a good idea to verify my ID. Once doing so, I get a verified checkmark next to all reviews that I post as well as on my profile. If you hover over the checkmark, it says:
>This user has verified their identity with a photo ID. We encourage both companies and reviewers to get verified, to help ensure real people are writing reviews about real companies on Trustpilot.

I thought it would be worth going through this hassle as it would be unlikely for Trustpilot to flag any of my reviews, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I can't help but question if verifying your identification actually makes any difference on whether or not your reviews get removed or restored.

After my ID was verified, I proceesed to leave reviews for some companies I've recently dealt with - 8 in total. Seven of these reviews were five star, and one of them was 2 stars. I put quite alot of effort into these reviews - I didn't just write a few small sentences. 

Around 2 hours later, I received an email from Trustpilot Content Integrity with the subject: "Andrew, your Trustpilot account has been suspended." I was horrified to hear ths - I kept asking myself what I did wrong. Upon reading the email, it was quite clear that I didn't do anything wrong. Below is the email:

Straight away I was wonderig exactly which review they thought was fabricated, and how they could possibly verify the authenticy of any reviews regardless if they're real or not. Especially in such a short period of time. Exactly 2 minutes after the initial suspension email landed in my inbox, I responded asking them to investigate:



> Hi,
> 
> I'm very concerned to hear my Trustpilot account has been suspended -
> something has gone wrong here. Please could you look into this?
> 
> Many Thanks.



I knew that I didn't do anything wrong  - all of my reviews were genuine. So I had some hope that this was just a one-off. Perhaps it was because I wrote 8 reviews within such a short period of time? If that was the case, then I could understand it. I also want Trustpilot to remove reviews that they think could be fake or suspicious in anyway. I want to know that the reviews that I'm actually reading are real, like anyone else. With all this in mind, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and hoped this situation would be resolved quickly.

8 days later I still hadn't heard anything back from the Content Integrity Team, so I decided to chase it up on Twitter. I sent a direct message to [Trustpilot's official support account](https://twitter.com/TrustieSupport):

> Good morning, On 24/11/2022

>

> 
> Many Thanks ðŸ˜€

Just over half an hour later, I received this response:

> Hi Andrew, thanks for reaching out. Sometimes when a user created

> 
> Thanks!

This was looking very promising - I was expecting someone to respond to my email that very day. Well, the day came and went, with no updates from Trustpilot. I waited another 8 days before I had to chase them up AGAIN! Despite being told that someone would be in touch with me that day. At this point I was quite fustrated - and I was starting to wonder if they were just ignoring me on purpose and couldn't be bothered to deal with the situation. I sent them another direct message on Twitter:

> Good afternoon, 
> 
> Are there any updates regarding my Trustpilot account? 
> 
> Nobody from the Content Integrity team has been in touch yet. 
> 
> Many Thanks ðŸ˜€

Exactly 19 minutes later, I received a response:

> Hi Andrew ðŸ‘‹ thanks for getting back in touch! Sorry to hear that you haven't heard from them - we've chased again now and asked that your ticket be prioritized in the queue. You should hear from them very soon. Thanks for your patience!

Thankfully, this is where the Twitter DMs stop - because 21 days after my account was suspended, I finally had a response to my email! I won't put the entire email here, but below is the most important part:

> Your review was removed because we couldnâ€™t verify its authenticity.
> However, if you send us documentation of your experience with
> dpd.co.uk weâ€™ll see if itâ€™s enough to verify your review and get it
> back online and unblock your account

DPD was indeed one of the companies that I left a review for - infact, it was the very first review that I left on the platform. I was even invited to leave this review as DPD used Trustpilot's tools to invite me. This is what I just don't understand - why would they struggle to verify the authenticy of a review that I was invited (using Trustpilot's own tools) to write! How could they verify the authenticy of the 7 other reviews I left? I wasn't invited to leave them all, but for some reason they were happy with them - why was my DPD review the one that got flagged? Straight away I started preparing my documentation - a few minutes after hearing back, I sent them the following PDF attachments:

 - DPD email saying my parcel would be delivered tomorrow
 - DPD email saying my parcel would be delivered today
 - DPD email saying my parcel was delivered
 - The email from Trustpilot, sent on behalf of DPD, inviting me to leave the review

I also sent them the tracking number link as well as my postcode. Around 15 minutes later, I finally had my account back!

> Hi,      
> 
> Thanks for providing us with documentation so we could verify
> your experience with dpd.co.uk
> 
>I'm happy to inform you that all your reviews are now back online and your account active again.     
>
> Have a nice day!      

After 21 days of waiting, and chasing them up twice, the situation was finally resolved. My account was no longer suspended and all of my reviews were back. But this isn't the end of the story - because I recently had another one of my reviews removed.

I made a purchase on Ebuyer and was once it arrived, like I was with DPD, invited to write a review. As before, the email came from Trustpilot which was sent on behalf of Ebuyer. I waited a couple of days to ensure my item didn't have any issues and decided to write my review. 2 hours after posting it, just like before, they removed my review! The only difference this time is that they didn't suspend my Trustpilot account, all they did was remove my review:

> Hi Andrew, 
> 
> Thanks for reviewing www.ebuyer.com on Trustpilot. We wanted to let
> you know that your review of www.ebuyer.com} didnâ€™t make it online or
> has been removed from Trustpilot by our dedicated software, which

From this email, I can gather that they  think my review was fake or not trustworthy. I still don't understand why their 'dedicated software' would flag my review. I already verified my ID with Trustpilot so they know I'm a genuine person, and I was even invited by the company to leave the review! What could I have possibly do on my side to prevent this from happening? The only thing I can think that could've gotten my review flagged is because it was short - I really didn't have much to say as everything went well. I was really happy with my Ebuyer experience, which is why I left them a five star review:

> My item was despatched on the same day of purchase and arrived the
> very next day. Item was packed really well - highly recommend.

After I posted my review of Ebuyer, I also left a review of the product that I purchased - I was invited to leave this as well as a review of the company. However, this was never removed, despite being directly connected. If they thought my review of of Ebuyer was fake, then you'd expect them to also remove the review I left of the product that was directly connected to my experience, right?

Taking my experience with Trustpilot in mind, I can't help but question how much you can actually trust the reviews left on the platform - could they be removing positive and negative reviews on purpose to paint a different picture of a company? I also wonder how often this happens - not everyone is going to bother going through the process to get the review back online, not to mention chase them up on a response twice! I suspect they were hoping that I would just forgot about it after waiting so long to receive a response. I really can't help but question how many genuine review get flagged by their system and never make it back online. I'm unsure if I want to continue using Trustpilot after all of this - will I have to go through this process all over again for a third time? Perhaps I am the fool here for trusting 'Trust' pilot in the first place.
