Instagram is a top-rated app owned by Meta, with over 5 billion downloads on the Google Play Store. I want to generate publicity for my Minecraft server, LU7 Creative, so creating an Instagram account would be an excellent opportunity to grow my community. Still, for some reason, Instagram seems to think creating an account violates their terms…

I have been debating whether to establish a social media presence for LU7 Creative, and I thought a Threads account would be a good start. I use Threads daily as a replacement for Twitter. (Yes, I refuse to acknowledge the new name...) I think Threads is a great social media platform which is why I decided it would make a nice starting point. But before I could get started on Threads, I had to make an account with Instagram despite not really having any plans to use it. So, I headed to instagram.com, entered my details and hit next. Everything was fine until I attempted to verify my email address with the code they sent me. When hitting the next button, it kept loading and was taking a little longer than I would've expected, but having not made an Instagram account in several years, I didn't think too much of it, that was until I was greeted with an error message in red text: "Sorry, something went wrong while creating your account. Please try again soon." Everything aside, wouldn’t “Please try again later” make much more sense? “Try again soon”; that doesn’t sound right to me.

As you can imagine, I was a little perplexed by this and just clicked the next button again, assuming it would work. But it didn't appear to be doing anything, so I went back to the Instagram sign-up page and started from fresh, only for the site to imply that I already had an account by putting a red 'x' near my email address and username after re-entering it and suggesting alternative usernames. Perhaps Instagram created my account successfully, and something went wrong elsewhere? I attempted to log in to my newly created account and was horrified to see that my account had been disabled for "violating our terms". Since I had just made the account and had yet to log in for the first time, I needed clarification about what I could've done wrong. All I had done was create an Instagram account; surely that can't be a violation of their terms?

It blows my mind to think I can create an account and have it disabled for seemingly violating the terms without even logging in. I decided to wait a few hours and then tried logging in again, but this time via the Instagram mobile app. Maybe my account being disabled was just a temporary error and would've been resolved. Nope, still disabled. I’m not really sure what I was expecting to be honest with you. This was when I stopped and wondered whether it was worth my time with Instagram. But since the appeal button was right there, I decided to try it. Will they be able to see their mistake when I submit an appeal, and then they re-enable my account? It'll just be a minor inconvenience for me. That's what I thought in my head until they told me my account had been deleted instead. They wouldn't be able to restore my account for whatever violation of their terms I supposedly violated, not even allowing me to submit an appeal or flag the decision as incorrect.

You'd think a company as big as Meta would have systems for customers to resolve severe issues like this. Still, when I went looking online for a way to contact Instagram, hoping I would find a 'contact us' form or something similar, I was disappointed to say I couldn't find anything. Considering how quickly this happened, it's safe to say this was an automated decision by a bot, or maybe even AI, considering how everyone and their aunt is bringing AI features to their products at the moment. But what does ChatGPT, a very popular website for communicating directly with AI Language Models say at the very bottom of their prompt box? "ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info." It’s pretty clear that AI and bots that make automated decisions can make mistakes. So, assuming the decision to disable and then delete my account was made by a bot, why can I not flag this up as an error? If OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a world-leading company in Artificial Intelligence isn’t 100% trusting of AI just yet, then why is Meta? If Instagram doesn't give users the option to do anything, it makes you wonder if they are even aware of just how many mistakes the system is making. I can't be the person who has created an account with good intentions only to have it instantly disabled despite not doing anything wrong. You have to think just how many people this has happened to, and the potential customers Instagram has lost. If their system flagged something I did as suspicious and my account was disabled for security purposes, I wouldn't have a problem. I would much rather go through a security check and help keep the platform safe for fellow users. But the fact that I can’t do anything about this is absurd. It would take a human less than 3 seconds to work out that my account was disabled in error. Still, because Instagram doesn't provide a way for me to contact anyone, I'm unable to make them aware of just how flawed their sign-up system appears to be, and because of that, Instagram has just lost a customer. I planned to sign up for Meta Verified, a " subscription bundle for creators and businesses that helps you show the world that your profile is authentic and build credibility with your audience.” According to a [Sky News article](https://news.sky.com/story/meta-verified-facebook-and-instagram-launches-paid-service-in-the-uk-12882286#:~:text=The%20verified%20service%20will%20be,it%20becomes%20available%20to%20them.), subscribing to Meta Verified via the website costs £9.99 monthly. But I will have to take my business elsewhere because Instagram has made it very clear that I’m not welcome on the platform. 

So, what's next? Honestly, I really couldn't tell you. I have met a roadblock with Instagram, and I don't think I can do anything other than accept their incorrect decision. This situation is a little sad; all Instagram had to do was give me the option to appeal. The second my appeal would land on someone's desk; it would be put straight into the accepted pile. Without a shadow of a doubt. But no, apparently, Instagram is way too trusting in whatever technology made the automated decision. If there's one lesson Instagram should learn from this incident, it's that AI and computers CAN make mistakes. They aren't perfect, and you should allow users to flag up potential incorrect actions taken from these systems. Otherwise, like in my case, you've just lost a potential customer. Without us, companies are nothing. Don't take customers for granted.

# UPDATE - Saturday 1st June 2024:

Since this blog post initially went live last night (Friday 31st May 2024), I'm pleased to say I have some updates regarding my Instagram Account. At 9:46am today (Saturday 1st June 2024), I received an email from Instagram, which just happens to be the first communication I've had from them other than the code to verify my email address. It reads: "Take action or lose access to lu7creative" which is a little confusing because 12 hours prior they said my account had been deleted and there's nothing I can do about it. So, in a period of around 15 hours, my account has gone from being created to disabled, and then deleted and then suspended? I don't understand why Instagram can't just use the same terminology throughout, it's not very consistent and quite honestly confusing. I think they need to pick a word to use and stick with it across the platform. Furthermore, last night, I was told my account was deleted for not following their terms and in their own words: "We're unable to restore accounts that are deleted for these types of violations." But now 12 hours later they're telling me to take action? This whole situation is getting really confusing with these contradictory messages. I find the reason for my account getting disabled very interesting though, apparently my account, or activity on it, didn't follow Instagram's Community Guidelines on account integrity and authentic identity. At this point, all Instagram knew about me was my account username, lu7creative, and my email address. I'm not really sure on what basis this decision was made. Anyway, I clicked on the review details button and entered my information to log in. I had to complete a captcha and then was asked to provide my email address again (not sure why), for which they sent another verification code to my email. After entering the code, I was instructed to add a mobile number, which I did and verified with the code in the text message they sent me. A few seconds later, it said that my appeal had been submitted. I had no idea I was submitting an appeal until now; the email gave me the impression that I was going to review the details regarding my account's suspension, and then perhaps be given the option to appeal. The page automatically updated a couple of seconds later, and my appeal was accepted. I just had to accept the Instagram terms and the privacy policy, and then I was finally able to access my Instagram account for the first time! I set up a Threads profile straight away, and a few hours later, while I’m writing this, I'm pleased to report that everything appears to be working well.

My experience raises some serious questions about why it had to happen in the first place. If the system thought there was something suspicious about my account or the details I provided when signing up, why wasn't I just asked to complete a captcha and add a mobile number there and then? I have no idea why they had to make this process so long-winded as well as give me so much contradicting information from the word go. I know many people who would've just given up from the first hurdle when it said something went wrong while creating the account, and I wouldn't blame them. I have no problem with Instagram disabling accounts that it thinks might not be authentic, but they really should implement changes to its processes to make it much more user-friendly for people trying to create an account with them. First, the message saying something went wrong while creating the account needs to go. It's simply untrue, as a few minutes late when I tried to login, it was pretty clear that my account was indeed created. It gives users completely the wrong idea as to what's happened. Instead, this is the part where it seems most appropriate to carry out the checks with the captcha, email and phone number that they had me do 15 hours later. This would provide the user a more streamlined experience without compromising Instagram's security. It’s also worth noting I had zero communication from Instagram via Email. If they are going to disable and delete accounts, wouldn’t you expect them to also send you an email about it?

I'm really pleased that I do now have access to my Instagram account. However, this raises some more concerns about what happens when I interact with the account and post content. What are the chances of getting my account disabled for logging in? If I can get my account disabled merely for creating it, then what's to say their automated system isn't going to mistakenly flag content I post as spam and disable my account all over again? Thankfully, my experience so far with content moderation has been positive, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't at least a tiny bit concerned after what happened yesterday.
